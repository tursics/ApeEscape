# ApeEscape

An ape has escaped from the Berlin Zoo. Nobody knows where it is right now. Take the underground train (blue line) or the express train (green line) to travel from one station to the other. You can only travel one station at a time. To head for the next station, touch it with your fingertip. You direct all three players (no multiplayer version yet). Keep in mind that you can only travel to a free station.

Now and then the ape will let you know its position and is visible for a short time. In an instant, it vanishes again and takes its next step in secret. In the left column, you can see which train the ape took. Get ready. Catch the ape!

## History

08/2013
  I started the development of the gameplay. Just a map of trafic lines and some player figures. The game is prepared for some Open Data (but has no yet).

09/2013
  At a Philips Hue/Amazon hackathon I added support for Phillips Hue lamps. The code still exists but is disabled. The 'light show' was not so good.

07/2015
  At the Coding da Vinci hackathon I got the chance to play with a "Makey Makey". I added a color sheme to the game and used apples to control the game. This was very funny. The code is commented out now. The problem is the limited input key count. I has only 6 input channels and needed 7.

01/2016
  For the Deutsche Bahn Challenge I added the first Open Data. The live API of parking and elevators.
