# ApeEscape

An ape has escaped from the Berlin Zoo. Nobody knows where it is right now. Take the underground train (blue line) or the express train (green line) to travel from one station to the other. You can only travel one station at a time. To head for the next station, touch it with your fingertip. You direct all three players (no multiplayer version yet). Keep in mind that you can only travel to a free station.

Now and then the ape will let you know its position and is visible for a short time. In an instant, it vanishes again and takes its next step in secret. In the left column, you can see which train the ape took. Get ready. Catch the ape!

## History

08/2013
  I started the development of the game play. Just a map of traffic lines and some player figures. The game is prepared for some Open Data (but does not use it yet).

09/2013
  At a Philips Hue/Amazon hackathon, I added support for Phillips Hue lamps. The code still exists but is disabled. The 'light show' was not so convincing.

10/2013
  I published a first version as an App (for Windows Phone). It works. But a 4" smartphone has a too small display for the game. Use a tablet. That's better.

07/2015
  At the Coding da Vinci hackathon, I got the chance to play with a "Makey Makey". I added a color scheme to the game and used real apples to control the game. This was pretty funny. The code is commented out now. The problem is the limited input key count - I had only 6 input channels but needed 7.

01/2016
  For the Deutsche Bahn Challenge, I added the first Open Data: The live API of parking and elevators.
